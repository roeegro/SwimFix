## Introduction
Our system has 3 main parts. The first one is the training infrastructure.
For more details, [click here](https://github.com/roeegro/SwimFix/tree/master/training).

The other 2 parts are used for the SwimFix web application and they include a web client part and a server for analysis and evaluation. Both parts written in Python and connect each other with TCP conneciton.

## Client Side
The client side is a web interface which supports 2 types of users : usual and admin ones. Usual user interface supports upload of video to the server (for analysis), view data and feedback about technique of previous swimming videos and also participate in forum. Admin users can also add tests and run them in the system in order to examine system's performance. More details about the user interface can be found in this [link](https://github.com/roeegro/SwimFix/tree/master/client).
We used Flask, a python web framework, to write the client side. This library enables the developers to load dynamically web pages with python code, define relations between pages, and even pass parameters from python code to html one.
